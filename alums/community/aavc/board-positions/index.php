<h3 id="g1">Board Requirements</h3>
<h4 id="g1q1">How Positions Are Filled</h4>
<p>AAVC Board members are nominated by the AAVC Nominating and Governance Committee and elected by the alums body at the Annual Meeting of Alumnae/i held during Reunion weekend. Any alumna/us may recommend herself/himself or someone else for consideration. Independent nominations may also be made by a petition signed by not less than four hundred (400) members of the Association representing at least fifteen (15) classes and ten (10) states. Any such petition should be filed with the Associate Vice President for Alumnae/i Engagement and Executive Director of the AAVC not more than thirty (30) days after publication of the slate of the Nominating and Governance Committee. Such petition must be accompanied by the written permission of the candidate.</p>
<p>Committee members develop a broad base of prospective candidates and review all recommendations, as part of their process of identifying alumnae/i with the experiences and skills that best match those needed for open board and committee positions. Professional expertise and service to Vassar are among the criteria used for nomination. The Nominating and Governance Committee also considers race and ethnicity, gender, sexual identity, geography, and other factors in helping to construct a board that reflects the talents and diversity of Vassar alumnae/i.</p>
<h4 id="g1q2">General Requirements</h4>
<p>All AAVC Board positions require a high degree of motivation to serve Vassar College and work with other alumnae/i in doing so. They also require a knowledge of, and sensitivity to, alums needs and concerns; strong project management and communication skills; the ability to work collaboratively and collegially; the ability to think strategically and creatively; and versatility. AAVC Board members are expected to commit a significant amount of time to their respective roles on the board and committees of the board. As key public representatives of the AAVC, board members should also be active participants in alums events and programs.</p>
<p><span>Board Meetings and Reunion Weekend:</span></p>
<p>The AAVC Board meets at the college three times a year, in October, February, and June. Attendance is required at these meetings, which are generally held from Friday evening until Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Reunion Weekend coincides with the June AAVC Board meeting. Board members are expected to attend and participate in Reunion events and programs.</p>
<p><span>Committee Meetings:</span></p>
<p>Much of the work of the AAVC Board is done through committees, which meet throughout the year, either telephonically or in person. Committees of the board also meet at the time of board meetings in October, February, and June.</p>
<p><span>Commitment:</span></p>
<p>AAVC Board members are expected to fully participate on the board and on committees of the board, which requires an extensive commitment of time and expertise.</p>
<p><span>Expenses:</span></p>
<p>So as to encourage all alums, regardless of financial circumstance, to participate, travel expenses associated with AAVC Board meetings may be reimbursed up to $500 per trip, or $750 per trip if air travel is required.</p>
<p><span>Vassar Fund Commitment:</span></p>
<p>All AAVC Board members are expected to support the Vassar Fund. While the amount of a board member’s gift is entirely discretionary, 100 percent participation by the board is extremely important.</p>
