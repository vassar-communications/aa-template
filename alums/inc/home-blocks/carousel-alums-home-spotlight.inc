  <h3 class="h3">Reunion 2023—Full of Joy and Laughter</h3>
  <p>The first weekend of June was a particularly joyous one for Vassar as the College welcomed back more than 1,200 alums from near and far for Reunion. While always a blast, this year’s festivities seemed extra jubilant as classmates rushed in for the tight hugs long denied during earlier pandemic years.</p>
