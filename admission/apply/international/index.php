  <p>When applying for admission to Vassar, anyone who is not a citizen or a permanent resident of the United States is considered an international student. If you have applied for a green card (permanent resident status) but have not received it by the time you apply, then you are considered an international student.</p>

  <p>Students apply from dozens of different countries each year and we receive academic records in a variety of formats. In general, your transcript should be a complete record of your coursework and grades from each marking period of secondary school, which is certified by your school. If you have taken required national/international exams during secondary school (ie. GCSE, IB MYP, CBSE board exams), these results should be included with your transcript. Any terminal high school exams (ie. A levels, IB exams, French bacc, CBSE) will be required for enrollment.</p>

  <p>Additionally, all of your supporting documents should be in English. If your school does not provide a transcript in English, we need both a certified copy of the original transcript and a translated copy in English. The translation should be completed by an agency, but can be done by a school official or English teacher, if an agency translation presents a financial hardship. Also, if your recommendations are translated from the language of instruction to English, please provide a signed copy of the original as well as the translation.</p>

<?php echo sec_regularContent(

  <p>We recommend that applicants who submit the TOEFL/IELTS also complete an interview as an additional way to demonstrate English language proficiency; students who submit Duolingo will have the interview portion of the exam reviewed as part of their application.</p>

  <p>Vassar also accepts interviews from <a href="https://initialview.com/">InitialView</a> and <a href="https://www.vericant.com/">Vericant</a>. While international applicants canâ€™t request alumni or student interviews, if we have interviewers in your area, we will reach out to you to set up an interview.</p>

  <p>Vassar meets the full demonstrated need of all admitted students who apply for financial aid at the time of their admission application. We are need-aware when reviewing applications from international students. Students who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents who wish to be considered for financial aid at any time during their years at Vassar must apply for aid at the same time that they apply for admission. Students admitted without financial aid in the first year are not eligible to receive Vassar funding during their years at the College. Financial aid is not available for international transfer applicants.</p>

  <p>If English is not the language of instruction for your past three years of secondary school, we still require you to submit English proficiency exam results.</p>
